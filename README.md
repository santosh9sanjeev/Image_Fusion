# Image_Fusion
An image fusion technique using Discrete Wavelet Transform method(DWT). The DWT makes use of the concept of wavelets to improve the resolution of the images. This Image Fusion method can be used for improving the resolution of satellite images, research projects etc. Metrics such as Mean Squared Error(MSE), Correlation Coefficient(CC) and Peak Signal Noise Ratio(PSNR) are also calculated using the math for these concepts. A good Image Fusion should have less MSE, high PSNR and high CC. 
Generally DWT method is possible for images having 1 channel only.In this Project we find out DWT Image Fusion for 3 channels(RGB) images and calculate the metrics for DWT method.This is done by converting the 3 channels into 1 channel each using NumPy and the DWT method is applied on each of the 3 channels for 2 images separately. Fused images consists of the low resolution or blurred images. In this project the project_images consists of 2 set of multifocal images.
